# Introduction
This repository holds configurations for my desktop, code editors, etc.
My configurations are not very clearly documented, so have fun trying to use it :)

# Neovim Configuration
## Prerequisites:
- The latest release of [Neovim](https://neovim.io).
- The GUI Neovim client [Neovide](https://github.com/neovide/neovide). (*Optional*)
<br>
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [LazyGit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit).
- [RipGrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for file searching.
<br>
- For editing C/C++ files, [ccls](https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls).
- CMake syntax highlighting via [cmake-language-server](https://github.com/regen100/cmake-language-server)

If you are on Windows, copy the `nvim` directory into `C:\\Users\\<your user name here>\\AppData\\Local`.
MacOS and Linux are not officially supported because I am not using them at the moment.

# Desktop Theme Configuration
These themes are for Windows only, if I ever do start customizing my desktop on other operating systems, there will be a seperate directory for that.

## Prerequisites:
- [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net) for adding custom themes and widgets.

1. Apply the `.theme` file on your Windows machine.
2. Then copy the Rainmeter skin into your Rainmeter skin directory (typically in `C:\\Users\\<your user name here>\\Documents\\Rainmeter\Skins`)
